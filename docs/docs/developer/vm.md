# Development virtual machine

The Intake24 development virtual machine provides pre-installed dependencies such as the PostgreSQL DBMS 
and Redis server, a blank system database and a (relatively) recent snapshot of the food database.   

This VM is intended to make getting started with Intake24 development easier, however it is not required to
set up a working development environment and all dependencies can be installed manually if preferred.

::: warning
Note that the VM currently does not include the portion size image database. These files will be added later.

## Download
 
An image of the latest version of the development VM is available for download here:
 
[https://intake24.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/vm/Intake24 V4 Dev Build f188a1f84a776326.ova](https://intake24.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/vm/Intake24+V4+Dev+Build+f188a1f84a776326.ova)

## Prerequisites

The VM image has been produced using [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) v6.0. The VM image format
is OVA 2.0 and can technically be used with most VM software, however it has only been tested using VirtualBox
and we therefore recommend using VirtualBox.

## Installation to VirtualBox

5. In the main menu of VirtualBox click `File > Import Appliance`.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

6. Select the VM image file downloaded from the URL above.

7. Change the name of the VM if you like, but keep the rest of the settings as they are. 

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<img src="../assets/img/vm/settings.png" style="float:right; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 15px; border: 2px solid lightgrey"/>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
 
9. Open the `Network` section and make sure that Adapter 1 is set to `NAT` and Adapter 2 is set to `Host-only adapter` 
attached to the Host Only Network you configured in step 2:

10. Resolve any other issues with the VM (e.g. video memory usage)

## System notes

The development VM runs `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS`.

### SSH access 

The VM is configured with a static IP of `192.168.56.4` accessible via the Host Only Network. You can log into
it from your host machine using SSH as `intake24` using the password `intake24`. This user has `sudo` rights. 

### PostgreSQL

#### Access

PostgreSQL is running on the standard port (5432) and is accepting connections from any network. SSL is off. 

The Intake24 databases are:

- System database: `intake24_system`, user `intake24`, no password.
- Foods database: `intake24_foods`, user `intake24`, no password.

#### Logs
 
The PostgreSQL server in the VM is configured to log all queries for debug purposes. The log can be found in:

`/var/lib/postgresql/12/main/pg_log`
