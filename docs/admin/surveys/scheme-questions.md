# Schemes questions

Schemes questions allows to define scheme question `templates` that can be reused throughout the schemes.

## Detail tab

Detail tab displays selected scheme question.

## Create / Edit tab

Edit tab allows to modify selected scheme question. It uses same editor UI as scheme section.

## Synchronization tab

Synchronization allows to push template changes to scheme, where the question with same `Question ID` is defined.

:::tip
Scheme question templates and question defined in schemes are linked by `QuestionID`. Hence it always needs to be unique.
