# Question templates

Question / Prompt templates allows to define scheme question `template` that can be reused throughout the schemes.

## Detail

Detail tab displays selected scheme question.

## Create / Edit

Edit tab allows to modify selected scheme question. It uses same editor UI as scheme section.

## Synchronization

Synchronization allows to push template changes to scheme, where the question with same `Question ID` is defined.

:::tip
Scheme question templates and question defined in schemes are linked by `QuestionID`. Hence it always needs to be unique.
