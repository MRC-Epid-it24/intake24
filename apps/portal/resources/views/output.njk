      <h2>Sample output files</h2>
      <p>Using the links below you can download sample output files generated by Intake24. Note that the data in these
      files are gathered from the demo survey submissions and are therefore not representable of a real survey in terms
      of survey contents.</p>
      <p>The portion size and nutrient calculations, however, are correct.</p>
