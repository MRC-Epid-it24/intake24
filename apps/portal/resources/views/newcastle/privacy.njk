      <h2>Privacy policy summary</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Here are the key points from the policy, however we encourage you to read the full document below.</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
        Intake24 has been developed at Open Lab, Newcastle University as a research project. Any information we collect
        from you will be stored securely in the EU and may be subject to further processing for scientific or statistical purposes.
        We often publish findings based on user activity, these publications will never contain information or data that could be used to identify you as an individual.
        </li>
        <li>
        If you are a study participant, we will not store any personal information about you. Dietary data that we collect from you is associated with an
        artificial user identifier that cannot be used to identify you as an individual based solely on the data stored by Intake24. Organisations or individual researchers
        conducting studies using Intake24 may be able to re-link dietary data to your identity based on additional information available to them.
        </li>
        <li>
        If you are an administrative user (i.e. you have a "staff" account for one or more surveys), we store your e-mail address, your name (or a pseudonym of your choice) and optionally your phone number,
        for the purpose of sending you important system notifications (e.g., when the data output for your survey becomes available) and to provide you with security features such as the password reset function.
        We also log your IP address every time you attempt to sign in for the purpose of security auditing in case of unauthorized access. We do not share your name, e-mail address
        or your phone number with third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
        Intake24 is hosted on Digital Ocean, uses Amazon S3 for storing encrypted data backups, SendGrid to distribute emails and Twilio to send SMS notifications.

      We may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits or other data,
      and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual (“Aggregate Information”).
      Aggregate Information obtained in connection with the Site may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources
      other than the Site, including both offline and online sources. Aggregate Information may be shared by us with third parties by allowing them to link to and

      <h4>Clickstream</h4>
      <p>
      As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes
      referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer
      and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data as a
      form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how visitors navigate throughout
      the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Site and our services.
      Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregated, and will not intentionally contain any personal information.
      We may also use this aggregated data in order to conduct academic research studies. As a result of these academic research studies we may
      publish the anonymous aggregated data we have outlined.</p>
