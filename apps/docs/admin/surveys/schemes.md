# Survey schemes

Survey recall flow is defined by scheme, which has couple of sections.

## Detail

Detail tab displays selected survey scheme info.

## Create / Edit

Edit tab allows to modify selected survey scheme.

- `Name` - `survey-scheme-wide` unique name

- `Visibility` - Record visibility, valid options are `public` or `restricted` ([record visibility](/admin/acl/securables#record-visibility)).

### Settings

#### Type

Placeholder at the moment for future to allow to define various types of survey schemes

#### Flow

Recall flow, valid options are `1-pass` or `2-pass` (default).

- `1-pass` - Flow goes through each meal including foods portion size estimation in order to complete the meal
- `2-pass` - Flow goes through each meal two times

  - `first pass` - Flow goes through each meal to collect meal info and foods (without portion size estimation)
  - `second pass` - Flow goes through each meal to collect portion size estimation

#### Recall date offset

Recall date offset in whole days.

- `empty` - survey won't record recall date
- `integer` - survey records recall date with specified offset from start of survey (e.g. `-1` for yesterday)
- Respondent can override / nominate their own recall date if [`recall date prompt`](/admin/surveys/prompt-types#recall-date-prompt) is included in the scheme

#### Languages

Languages participants can select to complete the survey in.

#### Help

Help form configuration for the survey.

- `available fields` - List of fields available in help form
  - `name` - Name field
  - `email` - Email field
  - `phone` - Phone field
  - `message` - Message field

If no fields are selected, help form will be disabled.

- `required fields` - List of required fields in help form
  - `name` - Name field is required
  - `email` - Email field is required
  - `phone` - Phone field is required
  - `email|phone` - Email or Phone field is required
  - `message` - Message field is required

### Default meals

List of predefined meals that will appear at the start of the recall.

Section allows to:

- Create new meals with default time and localized name
- Remove meals
- Load whole meal list from different scheme
- Reset the list to default one

## Prompts

Prompts tab allows to design dietary survey recall flow and define details about each prompt asked.

Prompts are categorized to sections and they are asked in specified fixed order. See table below.

| Section       | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Pre-meal   | Prompts asked about whole recall before dietary data entered |
| 2. Pre-foods  | Prompts asked about meal before foods were entered           |
| 3. Foods      | Prompts asked about the foods                                |
| 4. Post-foods | Prompts asked about meal after foods were entered            |
| 5. Post-meal  | Prompts asked about whole recall after dietary data          |
| 6. Submission | Prompts asked during data submissions                        |

Whole prompt sections group can be loaded from another scheme using `load from scheme` button.

When prompt section is selected, list of prompts appear below:

- New prompts can be added
- Prompts can be removed
- List of prompts can be re-arranged by drag & drop
- Prompt can be loaded from `template` defined in `scheme prompts` section
- Prompt can be saved as `template` if it doesn't exist yet (determined by unique `prompt id`)
- Prompt's settings can be synced from `template` if it exists (determined by unique `prompt id`)

## Data export

Data export tab allows to define fields, which will get exported to flattened CSV file having `food-per-row` with all additional fields.

Data export fields are grouped to sections.

| Section                  | Description                                                                            |
