/*
 Cylindrical symmetry volume esimation method.

 This method will estimate the liquid volume based on just the shape of the fillable
 area and the maximum fill volume without the need for a look-up table with additional
 intermediate measurements.

 This will only work correctly for shapes that are symmetric relative to rotation
 around the central vertical axis, which is true for all mugs, cups and glasses
 that are currently in the system.

 This method will also work for non-convex shapes (like the concave bottom of a
 wine bottle).

 enclosing the fillable area shape, cuts it along the vertical line at that coordinate,
